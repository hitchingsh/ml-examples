These are Machine Learning examples I have run and and in some cases created to give you a better understanding of my machine learning understanding. - Hamilton

** BERT GLUE E2E on TPU Notebook **
* This example downloads BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from tfdev.hub
* It fine tunes the training on one (any one) of the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) datasets
* More info about GLUE datasets can be found at: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13719.pdf]
* This example is copied from: [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/solve_glue_tasks_using_bert_on_tpu]

** BERT Fine Tuning Notebook **
* This example also downloads BERT  (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from tfdev.hub)
* It fine tunes the training and on the GLUE MRPC dataset from TFDS (tensorflow datasets)
* This example is copied from: [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/solve_glue_tasks_using_bert_on_tpu]
